## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars_summary}
summary(cars)

```

We now apply `skimr::skim()` to cars as an alternative to `summary()` in base R.

```{r cars_skim}
cars %>% 
  skim_without_charts() %>% 
  select(- n_missing, - complete_rate)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure_plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Here's the same graph as produced by `ggplot()`.

```{r pressure_ggplot}
pressure %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(
  x = temperature, 
  y = pressure)) + 
  geom_line()

```
